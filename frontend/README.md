# Digital Tabletop Character Sheet

This project is meant to replace a[ typical PDF character sheet ](https://ooyamaneko.net/download/rollespil/charsheet/Pathfinder_en.pdf)with something modern and built for computers.

For pictures of what the UI looks like, [you can check out the blog](https://fateforge.blog). Or to see the landing page with some demo components, go to [the website](https://fateforge.app). Login at the top right with demo / demo to give it a whirl. You can refresh to see the list of character sheets.

Note that feats and trait selection doesn't work at the moment due to some naming conflicts.

This isn't a demo project, it's a real one! My code isn't optimized, and I'm absolutely sure there's room for improvement. 

For example, all my actions should be in their respective actions file. I've started doing this moving forward (i.e the userActions) but I've yet to migrate all the character actions.

I've publicised this repo for my interview code review purposes. I'd love some feedback and the chance for an interview!

Thanks,

Steven Ireland


Note: If something is broken when loading a sheet, please create a new one. I'm constantly adjusting the data model (and for now, not worrying about it).
